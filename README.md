Computer-Human Interaction and Interaction Design
===============================================================================

This is the course material developed for my courses on Human-Computer 
Interaction, Interaction Design (mdi) and Usability for Mobile Devices 
(mdimob).  The material was developed during the years 2012--2014 at Mid Sweden 
University.

To compile the TeX files into PDFs: don't forget to `git submodule update 
--init`, since you need the submodules to build.


File structure
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The directories `mdi` and `mdimob` holds the course overviews (study guides 
etc.):

    mdi     Human-Computer Interaction and Interaction Design
    mdimob  Usability for Mobile Devices
    
These documents contains a short description of the course, intended learning 
outcomes, reading instructions.

The directories `projects`, `seminars` and `labs` holds assignment instructions 
including prerequisites such as reading instructions, intended learning 
outcomes, the assignment and how it's examined.

Currently, the directories `lectures` and `workshops` hold only reading 
instructions for what is covered in the lecture or workshop.  The reason for 
this is that most of my lecture notes are (still) in paper form, and some of 
the material are pictures copyrighted by others (e.g. the authors of the course 
textbook).
